# CryptoPrice-Alexa-Skill
This is the server side script for an Alexa Skill I created that grabs and converts cryptocurrency prices on the fly, and will also read you the latest news in the crypto markets.
It uses the cryptocompare API to fetch the latest price of several cryptocurrencies, and can also calculate dollar amounts from coin amounts, the Reddit API to get the news, and Amazon Alexa intents I created to understand what the user is saying. 

# Supported Coin Conversions
Bitcoin BTC
Ethereum ETH
Zcash ZEC
List LSK

# Usage
Ex1. "Alexa, ask coinprice what the price of bitcoin is"
Ex2. "Alexa, ask coinprice how much my 2 bitcoins are worth"
Ex3. "Alexa, ask coinprice to read me the latest crypto news"
